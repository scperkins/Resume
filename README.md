LaTeX files for my resume

The file depends on the library res.csl to compile properly.

For some reason, my install of Texlive did not include url.sty, which the compiler complains is necessary for hyper links (even though I've included the hyperref module)
when the 'pdflatex' command is called on the tex file.
I can ignore that though and press enter through the errors and the pdf is generated.
